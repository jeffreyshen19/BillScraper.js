# Valid bill types
This library can parse 2 distinct types of bills: "hr", "s"
Below is more detailed information about each bill type from the GPO.gov website:

 - House Bill (HR)
 - Senate Bill (S)

A bill is a legislative proposal before Congress. Bills from each house are assigned a number in
the order in which they are introduced, starting at the beginning of each Congress (first and
second sessions). Public bills pertain to matters that affect the general public or classes of
citizens, while private bills pertain to individual matters that affect individuals and organizations,
such as claims against the Government.
